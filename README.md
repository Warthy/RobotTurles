## ISEP School Project | A RobotTurles game in Java

RobotTurles is a board game that aims to teaches programming to kids.
As part of our Java class, we need to reproduce this game through Java while being free on picking any graphic
 interface.
 
 ### System
 
 * Java 1.8 (so JavaFX is included)
 * nothing else (expect a JVM to run program)
 
 ### Play it
 
 In order to play that game you simply need to execute the `RobotTurtles.jar` (double-click or `java -jar
  RobotTurtles.jar` in a cli) which is on the root of the repository
